MEAN retail app
https://webonlineshop.herokuapp.com

This resource was created for demonstration purposes only.

This website is built using MEAN stack. CSS style theme is based on a free Bootstrap template. jQuery is completely removed from the basic template and rewritten to be compatible with Angular framework. Some vidgets are based on the third-party libraries including Angular-UI-Bootstrap.

All data is stored in MongoDB. Backend part of the project is running on Nodejs. Communication between backend and frontend is performed with Expressjs framework.

Facebook and local login strategies are available.  Password change procedure is implemented using Email request. Other social login strategies are possible. 

Stripe online payment and currency online exchange services are integrated via external APIs.

This app is hosted on Heroku Cloud Application Platform. 
It's available by link: https://webonlineshop.herokuapp.com.
